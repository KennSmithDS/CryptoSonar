## About:
CryptoSONAR is a product for tracking short-term price signals for tokens on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) in the Decentralized Finance (DeFI) space. Â This tool enables users to securely login, add and remove wallets of other traders on the Binance Smart Chain such as whales and trading bots, to provide flash price alerts for buying or selling opportunities.

This project was started with starter code from `react-create-app`.
Note: Browser preferance for GoogleChrome

## Future Scope of Work:
* Upon detection of invalid wallet, turn off API data retrieval until new wallet selected or wallet address updated
* Ability to hide a token by address if it is determined to be scam, aka not something bought but forced transfer
* Improved logic for alerts to identify the exact new transactions in a wallet for the user to review
  * Includes back-end work to setup new collections in MongoDB to store transactions for wallets
  * Add new graphql query and mutation defintions for these collections 
  * Configure front-end to query the back-end tables instead of owning the task of data retrieval in AlertPanel
* Improved user authentication that doesn't use localStorage, and instead a service like Firebase, etc.
* Further aesthetic improvements to popup alerts/modals, etc.
* User wallet integration to allow for quick buy and sell of tokens identified in the alerts panel
* Expand details available to a user about a token or transaction, such as liquidity, USD value, etc.
  * Adding USD value visibility would require: 
      * Easy to fetch token to USD conversion in real-time, but...
      * Requires frequent API querying for each token, which...
      * Would create a bad UX waiting for 100s of responses on each rerender

### Iteration 3
* User Features:
  * Users are able to edit a selected wallet item
* Software Development:
  * Implemented update wallet on the backend schema and on the frontend gql call
  * Addressed user login bug by refreshing the page upon user log in.
